					<p>
						"Dissolve in Wind" an is interactive multimedia installation inspired by the unique natural phenomenon of strong winds in Hsinchu which eferred to as the "Windy City. 
						The powerful wind reshape local landscapes and significantly influence residents' bodily perceptions. 
						This artwork employs sonification and visualization to turn meteorological data into a multi-sensory experience. 
						Real-time wind data from the TaiwanCentralWeatherBureau is processed through audio synthesis to create dynamic soundscapes, while a real-time generative model transforms the data and participants' movements into flowing, wind-sculpted bodily forms. 
						By combining real-time data and generative AI, the artwork translates natural forces into an immersive artistic experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						This artwork employs a multi-sensory presentation of visual and auditory elements, inviting the audience to explore how wind influences bodily perception.
						As participants enter the installation, the projection screen reshapes and distorts their silhouettes, transforming them into fluid forms that merge and dissolve into the wind’s powerful presence. 
						At the same time, dynamic soundscapes generated in real-time from Hsinchu's wind parameters not only capture the physical essence of the wind but also reveal how it shapes the unique sensory experiences of the region. 
						By centering on the phenomenon of strong winds, the artwork embodies the city's spirit of place, creating an immersive experience that intertwines natural forces with local memory and invites profound interaction with nature.
					</p>
					<p>
						From a technological perspective, this system integrates real-time motion capture, environmental data, and a generative model to create an immersive artistic experience. 
						The installation dynamically connects to real-time wind data from the Central Weather Administration of Taiwan, capturing and simulating the dynamic nature of Hsinchu's winds. 
						The meteorological data is processed through sonification and visualization techniques: Max/MSP generates soundscapes from wind speed and direction data, while the real-time generative model transforms this data and participants' movements into distorted, wind-swept human forms. 
						These elements transform invisible natural forces into an engaging multi-sensory experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Dissolve in Wind” reimagines Hsinchu’s iconic winds as an interactive experience that strengthens the connection between nature and humanity through technology. 
						By visualizing and sonifying the wind’s force, the artwork invites audiences to reflect on how natural forces shape human experiences, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between humans and nature.
